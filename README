The tool should be executed from the utils folder.
Example: node streams.js --action=cssBundler --path=../css

For the sake of comfort, i've created two folders with files to test: 'data' and 'css'
In data there are some csv files
In css - css files to bundle them.

For more info, call: node streams.js -h
